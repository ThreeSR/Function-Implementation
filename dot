Note that unlike MATLAB, * is elementwise multiplication, not matrix multiplication.
We instead use the dot function to compute inner products of vectors, to multiply a vector by a matrix, and to multiply matrices. 
dot is available both as a function in the numpy module and as an instance method of array objects:

np.dot(x,y) # don't add another bracket
